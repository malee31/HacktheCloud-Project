# What is This
This is the repo for the Hack the Cloud submission.

Purpose
This is a website created to cheer people up whenever they're feeling down. It generates different activities (watching videos, images, etc).

Reasoning
Everyone experiences times where they feel unhappy, so we thought it'd be nice to create something that could be useful for people of all ages.
