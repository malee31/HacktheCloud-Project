# What is This
This is the repo for the Hack the Cloud submission.

Purpose
This is a website created to cheer people up whenever they're feeling down. It generates different activities (watching videos, images, etc) in order to cheer people up.

Reasoning
Everyone experiences times where they feel unhappy, so we thought it'd be nice to create something that could be useful for people of all ages. 

Challenges
Some of the challenges we faced were with the buttons. Another issue was the button was pressed, the result would be undefined and not work. After that issue was solved, there was another one. When the button was pressed, it would generate the video but, the video would not disappear. When we tried to fix it, it lead to both the button and video dissappearing after it was clicked twice. 

Future
Some of the features we can add in the future would be a better website layout, having more gifs, and being able to share videos with others.
